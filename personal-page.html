    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Just a few things about me. 
            I am 34 years old. 
            I was born in Minnesota. 
            I have lived here in Minnesota my entire life. 
            I have a 8 year old Husky mix named Luna. 
        </p>

        Some of my favorite activies include:
        </h3>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Video Games</h4></li>
        <p>
            I spend most of my free time playing video games with my friends.
            Down below is a list of some of my favorite games. 
            I have even built my own gaming desktop. Check out my photos page!
        </p>
        <li><h4>Hockey</h4></li>
        <p>
            I love the sport of hockey! 
            I started playing hockey through a local organization HockeyFinder about 10 years ago. 
            I never got the chance to play growing up, it is a pretty expensive sport. 
            I am glad I get to play now, it is a great workout and a lot of fun!
            I also love watching Hockey. The Minnesota Wild is my favorite team.
            Hopefully they actually do something this year!
        </p>
        <li><h4>Fishing</h4></li>
        <p>
            I grew up fishing from time to time. 
            As I got older I didn't have the opportunity and went a long time without fishing. 
            Last year I bought myself a fishing boat and enjoy taking Luna out to attempt to catch some fish. 
        </p>
        <li><h4>Hunting</h4></li>
        <p>
            Hunting is a bit of a new experience for me. 
            Growing up I always wanted to go deer hunting but never had the option. 
            My family wasn't into hunting so I had no opportunity. 
            A few years ago I decided to do a lot of research, watch a lot of Youtube, and take on the adventure myself. 
            So far I am unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Breweries</h4></li>
        <p>
            I love beer!
            It is pretty convenient that I live near Minneapolis with how many breweries there are. 
            I like a large variety of beers but blondes, ambers, and Oktoberfest style beers tend to be my favorite. 
        </p>
        <li><h4>Twitch</h4></li>
        <p>
            Twitch streaming service is a great place to go to relax and watch video games be played. 
            Some of the streams I watch are related to one of my favorite games (DOTA2). 
            My favorite DOTA2 streams to watch are usually the tournaments, watching pro teams compete in large LAN or online tournaments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the other main stream sections I visit relates to Star Citizen. 
            A space simulation game with a (somewhat) friendly player base. 
            These streamers range in play styles and personalities. 
            Some of my favorites are listed below. 
        </p>
